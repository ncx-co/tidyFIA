White spruce is a commercially and ecologically important species in northern Minnesota so I am interested in understanding more about the way it tends to grow across the region.

FIA data is useful for this type of quest so I am going to use `tidy_fia` to download and import the data so I can spend my time on the part of the process that I care about: learning about white spruce!

## Spatial data
There is a shapefile for just about everything on the internet, including one for all counties in Minnesota.
I googled "minnesota counties shapefile" and found the one I want on one of the first links (hint: if you see a download link button you can right-click and copy the web address where the file is stored).
I can use R to download and read the zipped shapefile, then filter the file down to the counties where I want to know more about white spruce
```{r counties}
counties_url <- "https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/GENZ2018/shp/cb_2018_us_county_20m.zip"

counties_zip <- file.path(
  tempdir(),
  "cb_2018_us_county_20m.zip"
)

download.file(
  url = counties_url,
  destfile = counties_zip
)

unzip(
  zipfile = counties_zip,
  exdir = tempdir()
)

county_shp <- file.path(tempdir(), "cb_2018_us_county_20m.shp")

counties <- st_read(county_shp) |>
  st_transform(4326)

county_names <- c(
  "Cook",
  "Lake",
  "St. Louis",
  "Koochiching",
  "Itasca"
)

northern_counties <- counties |>
  filter(NAME %in% county_names, STATEFP == 27) |>
  group_by(NAME, STATEFP) |>
  summarize(.groups = "drop")
```

Here is a map for some context:
```{r}
mn <- spData::us_states |>
  filter(NAME == "Minnesota")

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(
    data = mn,
    color = "black",
    alpha = 0
  ) +
  geom_sf(
    data = northern_counties,
    color = "black",
    fill = "darkgreen"
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Northern MN"
  )
```

## FIA data

Now I will collect the FIA "plot" and "tree" tables for Minnesota using the function `tidy_fia`.

```{r get_data}
aoi <- northern_counties |>
  summarize()

fia_data <- tidy_fia(
  aoi = aoi,
  table_names = c("plot", "tree", "county"),
  postgis = TRUE
)
```

Since the tree table does not have common names for the trees I am importing the REF_SPECIES table from FIADB using the function `read_ref_table`.
```{r ref_species}
ref_species <- read_ref_table("REF_SPECIES") |>
  select(spcd, common_name, sftwd_hrdwd)
```


## Analysis

Perhaps white spruce shows differences in height and diameter relationships with respect to the type of forest community it inhabits.
I am going to designate each plot as 'hardwood', 'mixed', or 'softwood' using plot basal area in hardwood/softwood trees in the tree table.

```{r plot_attributes}
plot_stats <- fia_data[["tree"]] |>
  left_join(ref_species) |>
  group_by(plt_cn, sftwd_hrdwd) |>
  summarize(
    bapa = sum(tpa_unadj * 0.005454 * dia^2, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |>
  ungroup() |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "sftwd_hrdwd",
    values_from = "bapa"
  ) |>
  replace_na(
    replace = list(H = 0, S = 0)
  ) |>
  mutate(
    total = H + S,
    type = case_when(
      H / (H + S) > 0.7 ~ "hardwood",
      H / (H + S) >= 0.3 ~ "mixed",
      H / (H + S) < 0.3 ~ "softwood"
    )
  )
```

Now I can filter the TREE table down to just live (`statuscd == 1`) white spruce.
```{r tree_ht}
white_spruce <- fia_data[["tree"]] |>
  left_join(ref_species, by = "spcd") |>
  filter(
    common_name == "white spruce",
    statuscd == 1, !is.na(dia), !is.na(ht)
  ) |>
  left_join(plot_stats, by = "plt_cn") |>
  left_join(fia_data[["county"]], by = c("statecd", "countycd"))
```

To get a sense for height/diameter relationships in white spruce I will make a graph that shows the trend by forest type and county.
```{r county_type_plot}
white_spruce |>
  ggplot(aes(x = dia, y = ht, color = type)) +
  facet_wrap(~countycd) +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(
    x = "DBH (in)",
    y = "total height (ft)",
    title = "white spruce in northern MN counties",
    caption = "smoothed relationship between DBH and total height across all\nwhite spruce observed on FIA plots since 2000"
  )
```

That graph is somewhat hard to read and does not show any obvious differences in height:diameter relationships so I will try one graph with a separate line for each county.
```{r county_plot}
white_spruce |>
  ggplot(aes(x = dia, y = ht, group = countynm, color = countynm)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(
    x = "DBH (in)",
    y = "total height (ft)",
    title = "white spruce in northern MN counties",
    caption = "smoothed relationship between DBH and total height\nacross all white spruce observed on FIA plots since 2000"
  )
```
